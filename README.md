# Weather Forecaster App

This is a simple command-line weather app written in Rust. It retrieves weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API based on latitude and longitude coordinates.

## Installation
To install the app, you will need to have Rust and Cargo installed on your system. Then, clone the repository and run the following command:

```bash
cargo build --release
```
This will build the app in release mode and create an executable in the `target/release` directory.

## Usage

To use the app, run the following command:

```bash
./target/release/weather-forecaster LATITUDE LONGITUDE
```

Replace `LATITUDE` and `LONGITUDE` with the desired values.

### Examples

Here are some examples of how to use the app:

```bash
./target/release/weather-forecaster 37.7749 -122.4194
```

This will retrieve weather data for San Francisco, CA.

## Configuration
The app can be configured using environment variables. The following variables are available:

    - `WEATHER_API_KEY`: The API key for the OpenWeatherMap API. If not set, the app will use a default key.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue on GitHub. If you would like to contribute code, please fork the repository and submit a pull request.
